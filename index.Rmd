Hi and welcome to my personal website!

I am a fourth year PhD student in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University. 

My main research interests lie around the determinants of environmental attitudes of individuals. I use observational data to study to what extent social norms, public policies and peer effects can affect the environmental consumption behavior and preferences of individuals. I am also enthusiastic about the analysis of any environment related issue, particularly through the use of novel or original data sources.

Prior to joining Columbia, I earned masters in [Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ppd-public-policy-and-development/), in [Environmental Economics from University Paris Saclay/AgroParisTech](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/environmental-energy-and-transport-economics#presentation) and in Engineering with a specialization in Energy from [Ecole Centrale Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/en).
