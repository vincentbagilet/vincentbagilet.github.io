Hi and welcome to my personal website!

I am a third year PhD student in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. 

In my research, I leverage observational data to study how social norms and peer behavior affect environmental attitudes of individuals. In general, I am particularly enthusiastic about empirical analyses of any environment related issue. 

Prior to joining Columbia, I earned masters in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics, in Environmental Economics from University Paris Saclay/AgroParisTech and in Engineering with a specialization in energy from Centrale Lyon.
