Hi and welcome to my personal website!

I am a fourth year PhD student in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. 

In my research, I leverage observational data to study 
<!-- I am interested in the determinants of the environmental consumption behavior of individuals.  through the use of observational data. -->
how social norms, public policies and peer effects affect environmental attitudes and preferences of individuals. I am also particularly enthusiastic about empirical analyses of any environment related issue. 
<!-- Enthusiastic about gathering original (and unconventional?) data -->

Prior to joining Columbia, I earned masters in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics, in Environmental Economics from University Paris Saclay/AgroParisTech and in Engineering with a specialization in Energy from Ecole Centrale Lyon.
