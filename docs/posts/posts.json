The resulting themes are, in my opinion, not strikingly nice but, hopefully, not strikingly ugly either, hence why the name of the package. More info and vignettes to get familiar with the package can be found on the package website.\nTo me, the most useful feature of my package is the function, set_mediocre_all(). When called at the beginning of the code, all subsequent graphs will be created using the new theme, without any additional line of code. This enables users to depart very easily from the nice but too often seen base ggplot themes and color schemes.\nI also tried to build my code so that it is reproducible. Users should be able to adapt it to create their own theme if they want to. The code for this package can be find on GitHub.\nThe base color palette is:\n\n\n\nHere are a couple of example plots of the theme and main color scale used but much more can be seen on the package website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also created a xaringan slides template in a style consistent with mediocrethemes:\n\n\n\nThis is a simple an application of the xaringanthemer package and can be very easily set up with the function mediocrethemes::xaringan_mediocre()\n\n\n\n",
