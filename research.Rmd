I am currently working on a few projects on the determinants of environmental attitudes of individuals. They are still at an embryonic stage but I will share my progresses here as soon as my projects are more developed and polished. I am also currently working on a couple of projects linked to causal inference methods.

# Work in progress

- Inference Design In Studies on Acute Health Effects of Air Pollution, with Léo Zabrocki [[Last version of the working paper](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/inference_pollution/paper.pdf) and [project website](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/inference_pollution/)].
<!-- - A trade-off between omitted variable bias and type M error, with Léo Zabrocki. -->
