```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "images/",
               cache.path = "cache/",
               cache = FALSE,
               echo = FALSE, #set to false to hide code

               dpi = 200,
               fig.align = "center")  
```

I am currently working on a few projects on the determinants of environmental attitudes of individuals. They are still at an embryonic stage but I will share my progresses here as soon as my projects are more developed and polished. I am also currently working on a couple of projects linked to causal inference methods.
