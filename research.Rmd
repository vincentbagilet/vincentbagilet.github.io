```{r setup, include=FALSE}

               cache.path = "cache/",
               cache = FALSE,

```

I am currently working on a couple of papers linked to causal inference methods and on a few projects on the determinants of environmental attitudes of individuals. Most of the latter ones are still at an embryonic stage. I will share my progresses on those here as soon as possible.

### Unconfounded but Inflated Causal Estimates

A **new version**, with substantial additions, will be published soon. A preliminary version of the new introduction is available [here](causal_exaggeration_intro.pdf).

The previous version of the working paper can be downloaded [here](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/causal_inflation/causal_exaggeration_paper.pdf). 

The project website can be accessed [here](https://vincentbagilet.github.io/causal_exaggeration/).
